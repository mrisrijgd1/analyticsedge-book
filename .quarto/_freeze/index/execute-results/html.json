In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property crime, called \"motor vehicle theft\" (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago.\n\nTo download this data, click: [mvtWeek1.csv](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/96f9b8f751467da3a4b8a5be33e32905/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x+2T2020+type@asset+block/mvtWeek1.csv)\n\n***Start:***\\\nRead the dataset mvtWeek1.csv into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frame \"mvt\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmvt <- read.csv(\"mvtWeek1.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**1.1: How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?**\\\nAnswer: 191641\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(mvt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 191641\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**1.2: How many variables are in this dataset?**\\\nAnswer: 11\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nncol(mvt)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 11\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**1.3: Using the \"max\" function, what is the maximum value of the variable \"ID\"?**\\\nAnswer: 9181151\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax(mvt$ID)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 9181151\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**1.4: What is the minimum value of the variable \"Beat\"?**\\\nAnswer: 111\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmin(mvt$Beat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 111\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**1.5: How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?**\\\nAnswer: 15536\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(mvt$Arrest)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 15536\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**1.6: How many observations have a LocationDescription value of ALLEY?**\\\nAnswer: 2308\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(mvt$LocationDescription == \"ALLEY\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2308\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**2.1: In what format are the entries in the variable Date?**\\\nAnswer: Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmvt$Date[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"12/31/12 23:15\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**2.2: What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset?
