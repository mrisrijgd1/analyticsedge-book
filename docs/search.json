    "text": "Stock Dynamics\nA stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of a company, and is one of the most popular ways for individuals and companies to invest money. The size of the world stock market is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE. In this problem, we’ll look at the monthly stock prices of five of these companies: IBM, General Electric (GE), Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, and Boeing. The data used in this problem comes from Infochimps.\nPlease download the following files: IBMStock.csv, GEStock.csv, ProcterGambleStock.csv, CocaColaStock.csv, BoeingStock.csv (do not open these files in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\nStart:\n1. Read the datasets into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frames “IBM”, “GE”, “ProcterGamble”, “CocaCola”, and “Boeing”, respectively.\n\nIBM <- read.csv(\"IBMStock.csv\")\nGE <- read.csv(\"GEStock.csv\")\nProcterGamble <- read.csv(\"ProcterGambleStock.csv\")\nCocaCola <- read.csv(\"CocaColaStock.csv\")\nBoeing <- read.csv(\"BoeingStock.csv\")\n\n2. Before working with these data sets, we need to convert the dates into a format that R can understand. Take a look at the structure of one of the datasets using the str function. Right now, the date variable is stored as a factor. We can convert this to a “Date” object in R by using the following five commands (one for each data set):\n\nIBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nGE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nCocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nBoeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\n\n1.1: Our five datasets all have the same number of observations. How many observations are there in each data set?\nAnswer: 480\n\nnrow(IBM)\n\n[1] 480\n\n# According to the assignment, use: str(IBM)\n# We only need to use the command for one of the datasets, since they all have the same number of obs.\n\n1.2: What is the earliest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 1970\n\nmin(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"1970-01-01\"\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations started on the same date.\n\n1.3: What is the latest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 2009\n\nmax(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"2009-12-01\"\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations ended on the same date.\n\n1.4: What is the mean stock price of IBM over this time period?\nAnswer: 144.375\n\nmean(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 144.375\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n1.5: What is the minimum stock price of General Electric (GE) over this time period?\nAnswer: 9.293636\n\nmin(GE$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 9.293636\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(GE$StockPrice)\n\n1.6: What is the maximum stock price of Coca-Cola over this time period?\nAnswer: 146.5843\n\nmax(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 146.5843\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n\n1.7: What is the median stock price of Boeing over this time period?\nAnswer:\n\nmedian(Boeing$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 44.8834\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(Boeing$StockPrice)\n\n1.8: What is the standard deviation of the stock price of Procter & Gamble over this time period?\nAnswer: 18.19414\n\nsd(ProcterGamble$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 18.19414\n\n\nSide note: According to the assignment, questions 1.2 - 1.7 should’ve been solved using the summary function. However, I used commands that would give more accurate answer. Along with the commands I used, I also wrote how the assignment could be solved using the summary function.\n2.1.1: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its highest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1973\n2.1.2: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its lowest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1980\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n2.2: In March of 2000, the technology bubble burst, and a stock market crash occurred. According to this plot, which company’s stock dropped more?\nAnswer: Procter and Gamble\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\", col = \"red\")\nlines(ProcterGamble$Date, ProcterGamble$StockPrice, col = \"blue\")\nabline(v=as.Date(c(\"2000-03-01\")), lwd=2)\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1: Around 1983, the stock for one of these companies (Coca-Cola or Procter and Gamble) was going up, while the other was going down. Which one was going up?\nAnswer: CocaCola\n2.3.1: In the time period shown in the plot, which stock generally has lower values?\nAnswer: CocaCola\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\", col = \"red\")\nlines(ProcterGamble$Date, ProcterGamble$StockPrice, col = \"blue\")\nabline(v=as.Date(c(\"1983-01-01\")))\n\n\n\n\nPlot to answer the following questions:\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date[301:432], CocaCola$StockPrice[301:432], type=\"l\", col=\"red\", ylim=c(0,210))\nlines(ProcterGamble$Date[301:432], ProcterGamble$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"blue\")\nlines(IBM$Date[301:432], IBM$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"green\")\nlines(GE$Date[301:432], GE$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"purple\")\nlines(Boeing$Date[301:432], Boeing$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n3.1: Which stock fell the most right after the technology bubble burst in March 2000?\nAnswer: General Electric (GE)\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date[301:432], CocaCola$StockPrice[301:432], type=\"l\", col=\"red\", ylim=c(0,210))\nlines(ProcterGamble$Date[301:432], ProcterGamble$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"blue\")\nlines(IBM$Date[301:432], IBM$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"green\")\nlines(GE$Date[301:432], GE$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"purple\")\nlines(Boeing$Date[301:432], Boeing$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"orange\")\nabline(v = as.Date(c(\"2000-03-01\")))\n\n\n\n\n3.2: Which stock reaches the highest value in the time period 1995-2005?\nAnswer: IBM\n3.3: Comparing September 1997 to November 1997, which companies saw a decreasing trend in their stock price?\nAnswer: Procer and Gamble, Boeing\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date[301:432], CocaCola$StockPrice[301:432], type=\"l\", col=\"red\", ylim=c(0,210))\nlines(ProcterGamble$Date[301:432], ProcterGamble$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"blue\")\nlines(IBM$Date[301:432], IBM$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"green\")\nlines(GE$Date[301:432], GE$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"purple\")\nlines(Boeing$Date[301:432], Boeing$StockPrice[301:432], col = \"orange\")\nabline(v = as.Date(c(\"1997-09-1\")))\nabline(v = as.Date(c(\"1997-11-1\")))\n\n\n\n\n3.4: In the last two years of this time period (2004 and 2005) which stock seems to be performing the best, in terms of increasing stock price?\nAnswer: Boeing\n4.1: In which months has IBM historically had a higher stock price (on average)?\nAnswer: January, February, March, April, May\n\ntapply(IBM$StockPrice, months(IBM$Date), mean) > mean(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n    April    August  December  February   January      July      June     March \n     TRUE     FALSE     FALSE      TRUE      TRUE     FALSE     FALSE      TRUE \n      May  November   October September \n     TRUE     FALSE     FALSE     FALSE \n\n\n4.2: General Electric and Coca-Cola both have their highest average stock price in the same month.
