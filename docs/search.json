    "text": "An Analytical Detective\nThere are two main types of crimes: violent crimes, and property crimes. In this problem, we’ll focus on one specific type of property crime, called “motor vehicle theft” (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car. In this problem, we’ll use some basic data analysis in R to understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago.\nPlease download the file mvtWeek1.csv for this problem (do not open this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\nStart:\nRead the dataset mvtWeek1.csv into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frame “mvt”.\n\nmvt <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/mvtWeek1.csv\")\n\n1.1: How many rows of data (observations) are in this dataset?\nAnswer: 191641\n\nnrow(mvt)\n\n[1] 191641\n\n\n1.2: How many variables are in this dataset?\nAnswer: 11\n\nncol(mvt)\n\n[1] 11\n\n\n1.3: Using the “max” function, what is the maximum value of the variable “ID”?\nAnswer: 9181151\n\nmax(mvt$ID)\n\n[1] 9181151\n\n\n1.4: What is the minimum value of the variable “Beat”?\nAnswer: 111\n\nmin(mvt$Beat)\n\n[1] 111\n\n\n1.5: How many observations have value TRUE in the Arrest variable (this is the number of crimes for which an arrest was made)?\nAnswer: 15536\n\nsum(mvt$Arrest)\n\n[1] 15536\n\n\n1.6: How many observations have a LocationDescription value of ALLEY?\nAnswer: 2308\n\nsum(mvt$LocationDescription == \"ALLEY\")\n\n[1] 2308\n\n\n2.1: In what format are the entries in the variable Date?\nAnswer: Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute\n\nmvt$Date[1]\n\n[1] \"12/31/12 23:15\"\n\n\n2.2: What is the month and year of the median date in our dataset?

    "text": "Stock Dynamics\nA stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of a company, and is one of the most popular ways for individuals and companies to invest money. The size of the world stock market is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE. In this problem, we’ll look at the monthly stock prices of five of these companies: IBM, General Electric (GE), Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, and Boeing. The data used in this problem comes from Infochimps.\nPlease download the following files: IBMStock.csv, GEStock.csv, ProcterGambleStock.csv, CocaColaStock.csv, BoeingStock.csv (do not open these files in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\nStart:\nRead the datasets into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frames “IBM”, “GE”, “ProcterGamble”, “CocaCola”, and “Boeing”, respectively.\n\nIBM <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/IBMStock.csv\")\nGE <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/GEStock.csv\")\nProcterGamble <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/ProcterGambleStock.csv\")\nCocaCola <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/CocaColaStock.csv\")\nBoeing <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/BoeingStock.csv\")\n\nBefore working with these data sets, we need to convert the dates into a format that R can understand. Take a look at the structure of one of the datasets using the str function. Right now, the date variable is stored as a factor. We can convert this to a “Date” object in R by using the following five commands (one for each data set):\n\nIBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nGE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nCocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nBoeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\n\n1.1: Our five datasets all have the same number of observations. How many observations are there in each data set?\nAnswer: 480\n\nnrow(IBM)\n\n[1] 480\n\n\n1.2: What is the earliest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 1970\n\nmin(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"1970-01-01\"\n\n\n1.3: What is the latest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 2009\n\nmax(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"2009-12-01\"\n\n\n1.4: What is the mean stock price of IBM over this time period?\nAnswer: 144.375\n\nmean(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 144.375\n\n\n1.5: What is the minimum stock price of General Electric (GE) over this time period?\nAnswer: 9.293636\n\nmin(GE$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 9.293636\n\n\n1.6: What is the maximum stock price of Coca-Cola over this time period?\nAnswer: 146.5843\n\nmax(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 146.5843\n\n\n1.7: What is the median stock price of Boeing over this time period?\nAnswer:\n\nmedian(Boeing$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 44.8834\n\n\n1.8: What is the standard deviation of the stock price of Procter & Gamble over this time period?\nAnswer: 18.19414\n\nsd(ProcterGamble$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 18.19414\n\n\nSide note: According to the assignment, questions 1.2 - 1.7 should’ve been solved using the summary function. However, I used commands that would give more accurate answer. Along with the commands I used, I also wrote how the assignment could be solved using the summary function.\n2.1.1: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its highest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1973\n2.1.2: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its lowest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1980\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n2.2: In March of 2000, the technology bubble burst, and a stock market crash occurred.

    "text": "Demographics and Employment in the United States\nIn the wake of the Great Recession of 2009, there has been a good deal of focus on employment statistics, one of the most important metrics policymakers use to gauge the overall strength of the economy. In the United States, the government measures unemployment using the Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects demographic and employment information from a wide range of Americans each month. In this exercise, we will employ the topics reviewed in the lectures as well as a few new techniques using the September 2013 version of this rich, nationally representative dataset (available online).\nThe observations in the dataset represent people surveyed in the September 2013 CPS who actually completed a survey. While the full dataset has 385 variables, in this exercise we will use a more compact version of the dataset.\nPlease dowload the following file: CPSData.csv\nStart:\nLoad the dataset from CPSData.csv into a data frame called CPS.\n\nCPS <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/CPSData.csv\")\n\n1.1: How many interviewees are in the dataset?\nAnswer: 131302\n\nnrow(CPS)\n\n[1] 131302\n\n\n1.2: Among the interviewees with a value reported for the Industry variable, what is the most common industry of employment?\nAnswer: Educational and health services\n\nhead(sort(table(CPS$Industry), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nEducational and health services \n                          15017 \n\n\n1.3.1: Which state has the fewest interviewees?\nAnswer: New Mexico\n\ntail(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nNew Mexico \n      1102 \n\n\n1.3.2: Which state has the largest number of interviewees?\nAnswer: California\n\nhead(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nCalifornia \n     11570 \n\n\n1.4: What proportion of interviewees are citizens of the United States?\nAnswer: 0.9421943\n\ntable(CPS$Citizenship)\n\n\n     Citizen, Native Citizen, Naturalized          Non-Citizen \n              116639                 7073                 7590 \n\n(116639 + 7073)/nrow(CPS)\n\n[1] 0.9421943\n\n\n1.5: For which races are there at least 250 interviewees in the CPS dataset of Hispanic ethnicity?\nAnswer: American Indian, Black, Multiracial, White\n\ntable(CPS$Race, CPS$Hispanic) > 250\n\n                  \n                      0     1\n  American Indian  TRUE  TRUE\n  Asian            TRUE FALSE\n  Black            TRUE  TRUE\n  Multiracial      TRUE  TRUE\n  Pacific Islander TRUE FALSE\n  White            TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n2.1: Which variables have at least one interviewee with a missing (NA) value?\nAnswer: MetroAreaCode, Married, Education, EmploymentStatus, Industry\n\nnames(which(colSums(is.na(CPS)) > 0))\n\n[1] \"MetroAreaCode\"    \"Married\"          \"Education\"        \"EmploymentStatus\"\n[5] \"Industry\"        \n\n\n2.2: We will try to determine if there is a pattern in the missing values of the Married variable.\nAnswer: The Married variable being missing is related to the Age value for the interviewee.\n\ntable(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n           \n            FALSE  TRUE\n  Midwest   24609  6075\n  Northeast 21432  4507\n  South     33535  7967\n  West      26388  6789\n\ntable(CPS$Sex, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n        \n         FALSE  TRUE\n  Female 55264 12217\n  Male   50700 13121\n\ntable(CPS$Age, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n    \n     FALSE TRUE\n  0      0 1283\n  1      0 1559\n  2      0 1574\n  3      0 1693\n  4      0 1695\n  5      0 1795\n  6      0 1721\n  7      0 1681\n  8      0 1729\n  9      0 1748\n  10     0 1750\n  11     0 1721\n  12     0 1797\n  13     0 1802\n  14     0 1790\n  15  1795    0\n  16  1751    0\n  17  1764    0\n  18  1596    0\n  19  1517    0\n  20  1398    0\n  21  1525    0\n  22  1536    0\n  23  1638    0\n  24  1627    0\n  25  1604    0\n  26  1643    0\n  27  1657    0\n  28  1736    0\n  29  1645    0\n  30  1854    0\n  31  1762    0\n  32  1790    0\n  33  1804    0\n  34  1653    0\n  35  1716    0\n  36  1663    0\n  37  1531    0\n  38  1530    0\n  39  1542    0\n  40  1571    0\n  41  1673    0\n  42  1711    0\n  43  1819    0\n  44  1764    0\n  45  1749    0\n  46  1665    0\n  47  1647    0\n  48  1791    0\n  49  1989    0\n  50  1966    0\n  51  1931    0\n  52  1935    0\n  53  1994    0\n  54  1912    0\n  55  1895    0\n  56  1935    0\n  57  1827    0\n  58  1874    0\n  59  1758    0\n  60  1746    0\n  61  1735    0\n  62  1595    0\n  63  1596    0\n  64  1519    0\n  65  1569    0\n  66  1577    0\n  67  1227    0\n  68  1130    0\n  69  1062    0\n  70  1195    0\n  71  1031    0\n  72   941    0\n  73   896    0\n  74   842    0\n  75   763    0\n  76   729    0\n  77   698    0\n  78   659    0\n  79   661    0\n  80  2664    0\n  85  2446    0\n\ntable(CPS$Citizenship, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n                      \n                       FALSE  TRUE\n  Citizen, Native      91956 24683\n  Citizen, Naturalized  6910   163\n  Non-Citizen           7098   492\n\n\n2.3.1: How many states had all interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area (aka they have a missing MetroAreaCode value)?

compact way to encode factor variables with text as their possible values, and they are therefore quite common in survey datasets. In fact, all but one of the variables in this dataset were actually stored by a numeric code in the original CPS datafile.\nWhen analyzing a variable stored by a numeric code, we will often want to convert it into the values the codes represent. To do this, we will use a dictionary, which maps the the code to the actual value of the variable. We have provided dictionaries MetroAreaCodes.csv and CountryCodes.csv, which respectively map MetroAreaCode and CountryOfBirthCode into their true values. Read these two dictionaries into data frames MetroAreaMap and CountryMap:\n\nMetroAreaMap <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/MetroAreaCodes.csv\")\nCountryMap <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit1/CountryCodes.csv\")\n\n3.1.1: How many observations (codes for metropolitan areas) are there in MetroAreaMap?\nAnswer: 271\n\nnrow(MetroAreaMap)\n\n[1] 271\n\n\n3.1.2: How many observations (codes for countries) are there in CountryMap?\nAnswer: 149\n\nnrow(CountryMap)\n\n[1] 149\n\n\nTo merge in the metropolitan areas, we want to connect the field MetroAreaCode from the CPS data frame with the field Code in MetroAreaMap. The following command merges the two data frames on these columns, overwriting the CPS data frame with the result:\n\nCPS = merge(CPS, MetroAreaMap, by.x = \"MetroAreaCode\", by.y = \"Code\", all.x =

    "text": "Internet Privacy Poll (OPTIONAL)\nInternet privacy has gained widespread attention in recent years. To measure the degree to which people are concerned about hot-button issues like Internet privacy, social scientists conduct polls in which they interview a large number of people about the topic. In this assignment, we will analyze data from a July 2013 Pew Internet and American Life Project poll on Internet anonymity and privacy, which involved interviews across the United States. While the full polling data can be found here, we will use a more limited version of the results, available in AnonymityPoll.csv.\nStart:\nUsing read.csv(), load the dataset from AnonymityPoll.csv

    "text": "Reading Test Scores\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a test given every three years to 15-year-old students from around the world to evaluate their performance in mathematics, reading, and science. This test provides a quantitative way to compare the performance of students from different parts of the world. In this homework assignment, we will predict the reading scores of students from the United States of America on the 2009 PISA exam.\nThe datasets pisa2009train.csv and pisa2009test.csv contain information about the demographics and schools for American students taking the exam, derived from 2009 PISA Public-Use Data Files distributed by the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). While the datasets are not supposed to contain identifying information about students taking the test, by using the data you are bound by them NCES data use agreement, which prohibits any attempt to determine the identity of any student in the datasets.\nStart:\nLoad the training and testing sets pisa2009train.csv and pisa2009test.csv using the read.csv() function, and save them as variables with the names pisaTrain and pisaTest.\n\npisaTrain <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit2/pisa2009train.csv\")\npisaTest <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/DatasetsUnit2/pisa2009test.csv\")\n\n1.1: How many students are there in the training set?\nAnswer: 3663\n\nnrow(pisaTrain)\n\n[1] 3663\n\n\n1.2.1: Using tapply() on pisaTrain, what is the average reading test score of males\nAnswer: 483.5325\n1.2.2: Using tapply() on pisaTrain, what is the average reading test score of females?\nAnswer: 512.9406\n\ntapply(pisaTrain$readingScore, pisaTrain$male, mean)\n\n       0        1 \n512.9406 483.5325 \n\n\n1.3: Which variables are missing data in at least one observation in the training set?\nAnswer: Check output\n\nnames(which(colSums(is.na(pisaTrain)) > 0))\n\n [1] \"raceeth\"               \"preschool\"             \"expectBachelors\"      \n [4] \"motherHS\"              \"motherBachelors\"       \"motherWork\"           \n [7] \"fatherHS\"              \"fatherBachelors\"       \"fatherWork\"           \n[10] \"selfBornUS\"            \"motherBornUS\"          \"fatherBornUS\"         \n[13] \"englishAtHome\"         \"computerForSchoolwork\" \"read30MinsADay\"       \n[16] \"minutesPerWeekEnglish\" \"studentsInEnglish\"     \"schoolHasLibrary\"     \n[19] \"schoolSize\"           \n\n\nLinear regression discards observations with missing data, so we will remove all such observations from the training and testing sets:\n\npisaTrain <- na.omit(pisaTrain)\npisaTest <- na.omit(pisaTest)\n\n1.4: How many observations are now in the training/testing set?\nAnswer: 2414/990 respectively\n\nnrow(pisaTrain)\n\n[1] 2414\n\nnrow(pisaTest)\n\n[1] 990\n\n\n2.1: Which of the variables grade, male and raceeth is an unordered or ordered factor with a min. of 3 values\nAnswer: grade - ordered (ex. 8, 9, 10, 11) male - only has 2 values raceeth - unordered (no way to sepcifically order it)\nHow to include unordered factors in a linear regression model:\nTo include unordered factors in a linear regression model, we define one level as the “reference level” and add a binary variable for each of the remaining levels. In this way, a factor with n levels is replaced by n-1 binary variables. The reference level is typically selected to be the most frequently occurring level in the dataset.\nAs an example, consider the unordered factor variable “color”, with levels “red”, “green”, and “blue”. If “green” were the reference level, then we would add binary variables colorred and colorblue to a linear regression problem. All red examples would have colorred = 1 and colorblue = 0. All blue examples would have colorred = 0 and colorblue = 1. All green examples would have colorred = 0 and colorblue = 0.\nNow, consider the variable “raceeth” in our problem, which has levels “American Indian/Alaska Native”, “Asian”, “Black”, “Hispanic”, “More than one race”, “Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander”, and “White”. Because it is the most common in our population, we will select White as the reference level.\n2.2: Which binary variables will be included in the regression model?\nAnswer: We create a binary variable for each level except the reference level, so we would create all these variables except for raceethWhite.\n2.3: For a student who is Asian, which binary variables would be set to 0? What about a student who is white?\nAnswer: An Asian student will have raceethAsian set to 1 and all other raceeth binary variables set to 0. Since “White” is the reference level, a white student will have all raceeth binary variables set to 0.\n\nBecause the race variable takes on text values, it was loaded as a factor variable when we read in the dataset with read.csv() – you can see this when you run str(pisaTrain) or str(pisaTest). However, by default R selects the first level alphabetically (“American Indian/Alaska Native”) as the reference level of our factor instead of the most common level (“White”). Set the reference level of the factor by typing the following two lines in your R console:\n\npisaTrain$raceeth = relevel(factor(pisaTrain$raceeth), \"White\")\npisaTest$raceeth = relevel(factor(pisaTest$raceeth), \"White\")\n\nNow, build a linear regression model (call it lmScore) using the training set to predict readingScore using all the remaining variables:\n\nlmScore <- lm(readingScore ~ ., data = pisaTrain)\n\n3.1: What is the Multiple R-squared value of lmScore on the training set?\nAnswer: 0.3251\n\nsummary(lmScore)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = readingScore ~ ., data = pisaTrain)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-247.44  -48.86    1.86   49.77  217.18 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                                Estimate Std.
