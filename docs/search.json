    "section": "Stock Dynamics",
    "text": "Stock Dynamics\nA stock market is where buyers and sellers trade shares of a company, and is one of the most popular ways for individuals and companies to invest money. The size of the world stock market is now estimated to be in the trillions. The largest stock market in the world is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in New York City. About 2,800 companies are listed on the NYSE. In this problem, we’ll look at the monthly stock prices of five of these companies: IBM, General Electric (GE), Procter and Gamble, Coca Cola, and Boeing. The data used in this problem comes from Infochimps.\nPlease download the following files: IBMStock.csv, GEStock.csv, ProcterGambleStock.csv, CocaColaStock.csv, BoeingStock.csv (do not open these files in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).\nStart:\n1. Read the datasets into R, using the read.csv function, and call the data frames “IBM”, “GE”, “ProcterGamble”, “CocaCola”, and “Boeing”, respectively.\n\nIBM <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/IBMStock.csv\")\nGE <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/GEStock.csv\")\nProcterGamble <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/ProcterGambleStock.csv\")\nCocaCola <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/CocaColaStock.csv\")\nBoeing <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/BoeingStock.csv\")\n\n2. Before working with these data sets, we need to convert the dates into a format that R can understand. Take a look at the structure of one of the datasets using the str function. Right now, the date variable is stored as a factor. We can convert this to a “Date” object in R by using the following five commands (one for each data set):\n\nIBM$Date = as.Date(IBM$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nGE$Date = as.Date(GE$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nCocaCola$Date = as.Date(CocaCola$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nProcterGamble$Date = as.Date(ProcterGamble$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\nBoeing$Date = as.Date(Boeing$Date, \"%m/%d/%y\")\n\n1.1: Our five datasets all have the same number of observations. How many observations are there in each data set?\nAnswer: 480\n\nnrow(IBM)\n\n[1] 480\n\n# According to the assignment, use: str(IBM)\n# We only need to use the command for one of the datasets, since they all have the same number of obs.\n\n1.2: What is the earliest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 1970\n\nmin(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"1970-01-01\"\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations started on the same date.\n\n1.3: What is the latest year in our datasets?\nAnswer: 2009\n\nmax(IBM$Date)\n\n[1] \"2009-12-01\"\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$Date)\n# Again, we only need to use the command for one of the datsets, since the observations ended on the same date.\n\n1.4: What is the mean stock price of IBM over this time period?\nAnswer: 144.375\n\nmean(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 144.375\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(IBM$StockPrice)\n\n1.5: What is the minimum stock price of General Electric (GE) over this time period?\nAnswer: 9.293636\n\nmin(GE$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 9.293636\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(GE$StockPrice)\n\n1.6: What is the maximum stock price of Coca-Cola over this time period?\nAnswer: 146.5843\n\nmax(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 146.5843\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(CocaCola$StockPrice)\n\n1.7: What is the median stock price of Boeing over this time period?\nAnswer:\n\nmedian(Boeing$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 44.8834\n\n# According to the assignment, use: summary(Boeing$StockPrice)\n\n1.8: What is the standard deviation of the stock price of Procter & Gamble over this time period?\nAnswer: 18.19414\n\nsd(ProcterGamble$StockPrice)\n\n[1] 18.19414\n\n\nSide note: According to the assignment, questions 1.2 - 1.7 should’ve been solved using the summary function. However, I used commands that would give more accurate answer. Along with the commands I used, I also wrote how the assignment could be solved using the summary function.\n2.1.1: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its highest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1973\n2.1.2: Around what year did Coca-Cola has its lowest stock price in this time period?\nAnswer: 1980\n\nplot(CocaCola$Date, CocaCola$StockPrice, \"l\")\n\n\n\n\n2.2: In March of 2000, the technology bubble burst, and a stock market crash occurred.

    "text": "Demographics and Employment in the United States\nIn the wake of the Great Recession of 2009, there has been a good deal of focus on employment statistics, one of the most important metrics policymakers use to gauge the overall strength of the economy. In the United States, the government measures unemployment using the Current Population Survey (CPS), which collects demographic and employment information from a wide range of Americans each month. In this exercise, we will employ the topics reviewed in the lectures as well as a few new techniques using the September 2013 version of this rich, nationally representative dataset (available online).\nThe observations in the dataset represent people surveyed in the September 2013 CPS who actually completed a survey. While the full dataset has 385 variables, in this exercise we will use a more compact version of the dataset.\nPlease dowload the following file: CPSData.csv\nStart:\nLoad the dataset from CPSData.csv into a data frame called CPS.\n\nCPS <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/CPSData.csv\")\n\n1.1: How many interviewees are in the dataset?\nAnswer: 131302\n\nnrow(CPS)\n\n[1] 131302\n\n\n1.2: Among the interviewees with a value reported for the Industry variable, what is the most common industry of employment?\nAnswer: Educational and health services\n\nhead(sort(table(CPS$Industry), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nEducational and health services \n                          15017 \n\n\n1.3.1: Which state has the fewest interviewees?\nAnswer: New Mexico\n\ntail(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nNew Mexico \n      1102 \n\n\n1.3.2: Which state has the largest number of interviewees?\nAnswer: California\n\nhead(sort(table(CPS$State), decreasing = TRUE), 1)\n\n\nCalifornia \n     11570 \n\n\n1.4: What proportion of interviewees are citizens of the United States?\nAnswer: 0.9421943\n\ntable(CPS$Citizenship)\n\n\n     Citizen, Native Citizen, Naturalized          Non-Citizen \n              116639                 7073                 7590 \n\n(116639+7073)/nrow(CPS)\n\n[1] 0.9421943\n\n\n1.5: For which races are there at least 250 interviewees in the CPS dataset of Hispanic ethnicity?\nAnswer: American Indian, Black, Multiracial, White\n\ntable(CPS$Race, CPS$Hispanic) > 250\n\n                  \n                      0     1\n  American Indian  TRUE  TRUE\n  Asian            TRUE FALSE\n  Black            TRUE  TRUE\n  Multiracial      TRUE  TRUE\n  Pacific Islander TRUE FALSE\n  White            TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n2.1: Which variables have at least one interviewee with a missing (NA) value?\nAnswer: MetroAreaCode, Married, Education, EmploymentStatus, Industry\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$PeopleInHousehold)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Region)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$State)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$MetroAreaCode)) > 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Age)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Married)) > 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Sex)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Education)) > 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Race)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Hispanic)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$CountryOfBirthCode)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Citizenship)) > 0\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$EmploymentStatus)) > 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nsum(is.na(CPS$Industry)) > 0\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n2.2: We will try to determine if there is a pattern in the missing values of the Married variable.\nAnswer: The Married variable being missing is related to the Age value for the interviewee.\n\ntable(CPS$Region, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n           \n            FALSE  TRUE\n  Midwest   24609  6075\n  Northeast 21432  4507\n  South     33535  7967\n  West      26388  6789\n\ntable(CPS$Sex, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n        \n         FALSE  TRUE\n  Female 55264 12217\n  Male   50700 13121\n\ntable(CPS$Age, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n    \n     FALSE TRUE\n  0      0 1283\n  1      0 1559\n  2      0 1574\n  3      0 1693\n  4      0 1695\n  5      0 1795\n  6      0 1721\n  7      0 1681\n  8      0 1729\n  9      0 1748\n  10     0 1750\n  11     0 1721\n  12     0 1797\n  13     0 1802\n  14     0 1790\n  15  1795    0\n  16  1751    0\n  17  1764    0\n  18  1596    0\n  19  1517    0\n  20  1398    0\n  21  1525    0\n  22  1536    0\n  23  1638    0\n  24  1627    0\n  25  1604    0\n  26  1643    0\n  27  1657    0\n  28  1736    0\n  29  1645    0\n  30  1854    0\n  31  1762    0\n  32  1790    0\n  33  1804    0\n  34  1653    0\n  35  1716    0\n  36  1663    0\n  37  1531    0\n  38  1530    0\n  39  1542    0\n  40  1571    0\n  41  1673    0\n  42  1711    0\n  43  1819    0\n  44  1764    0\n  45  1749    0\n  46  1665    0\n  47  1647    0\n  48  1791    0\n  49  1989    0\n  50  1966    0\n  51  1931    0\n  52  1935    0\n  53  1994    0\n  54  1912    0\n  55  1895    0\n  56  1935    0\n  57  1827    0\n  58  1874    0\n  59  1758    0\n  60  1746    0\n  61  1735    0\n  62  1595    0\n  63  1596    0\n  64  1519    0\n  65  1569    0\n  66  1577    0\n  67  1227    0\n  68  1130    0\n  69  1062    0\n  70  1195    0\n  71  1031    0\n  72   941    0\n  73   896    0\n  74   842    0\n  75   763    0\n  76   729    0\n  77   698    0\n  78   659    0\n  79   661    0\n  80  2664    0\n  85  2446    0\n\ntable(CPS$Citizenship, is.na(CPS$Married))\n\n                      \n                       FALSE  TRUE\n  Citizen, Native      91956 24683\n  Citizen, Naturalized  6910   163\n  Non-Citizen           7098   492\n\n\n2.3.1: How many states had all interviewees living in a non-metropolitan area (aka they have a missing MetroAreaCode value)?

In fact, all but one of the variables in this dataset were actually stored by a numeric code in the original CPS datafile.\nWhen analyzing a variable stored by a numeric code, we will often want to convert it into the values the codes represent. To do this, we will use a dictionary, which maps the the code to the actual value of the variable. We have provided dictionaries MetroAreaCodes.csv and CountryCodes.csv, which respectively map MetroAreaCode and CountryOfBirthCode into their true values. Read these two dictionaries into data frames MetroAreaMap and CountryMap.\n\nMetroAreaMap <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/MetroAreaCodes.csv\")\nCountryMap <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/CountryCodes.csv\")\n\n3.1.1: How many observations (codes for metropolitan areas) are there in MetroAreaMap?\nAnswer: 271\n\nnrow(MetroAreaMap)\n\n[1] 271\n\n\n3.1.2: How many observations (codes for countries) are there in CountryMap?\nAnswer: 149\n\nnrow(CountryMap)\n\n[1] 149\n\n\nTo merge in the metropolitan areas, we want to connect the field MetroAreaCode from the CPS data frame with the field Code in MetroAreaMap. The following command merges the two data frames on these columns, overwriting the CPS data frame with the result:\n\nCPS = merge(CPS, MetroAreaMap, by.x = \"MetroAreaCode\", by.y = \"Code\", all.x =

    "text": "Internet Privacy Poll (OPTIONAL)\nInternet privacy has gained widespread attention in recent years. To measure the degree to which people are concerned about hot-button issues like Internet privacy, social scientists conduct polls in which they interview a large number of people about the topic. In this assignment, we will analyze data from a July 2013 Pew Internet and American Life Project poll on Internet anonymity and privacy, which involved interviews across the United States. While the full polling data can be found here, we will use a more limited version of the results, available in AnonymityPoll.csv.\nStart:\nUsing read.csv(), load the dataset from AnonymityPoll.csv into a data frame called poll.\n\npoll <- read.csv(\"/cloud/project/analyticsedge/Datasets/AnonymityPoll.csv\")\n\n1.1: How many people participated in the poll?\nAnswer: 1002\n\nnrow(poll)\n\n[1]
